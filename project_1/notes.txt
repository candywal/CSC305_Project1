Thing that I need to do:
	Go through each article in the json input and create objects with it. 
	For each artcile, print on a new line title, description, time, and url and then leave a line

Parser

(X) parser needs to return a list of objects that represent the articles that were parsed. 

The team wants to use the parser regardless of the JSON source (code should just parse JSON)

Error 
(X) If an error is found in article, it is skipped. Articles without errors are returned to client.
(X) If an error is found when processing the JSON, the error must be reported - the parser needs to take a java.util.logging.Logger
(X) object as an argument - should be reported as a _warning_
(X) FileHandler along with a SimpleFormatter should be used - disable the the default log record handler and establish a new handler using those
	(x)create a log file

Testing
(X) Test for inputs with missing fields
	ceate 2 article json 
(X) Test for valid inputs to verify that all articles are parsed
	test the first one 
Main Demo
(X) Create a class with a main method, input JSON files are input.json and bad.json 
(X) Main method errors should be logged in the logger for your main class (which should log to a different file) 
(X) For each article, print the title, the description time, and url; leave a blank line between each article

Documentation
(X) JavaDoc comment for every public method, brief description of the purpose and each parameter and return value
